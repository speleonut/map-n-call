These scripts are here predominantly for historical purposes. Use GATK4 scripts instead.

HOW TO MAP TO GENOMES

The genome alignment scripts are included in this folder.  The scripts form a set of dependent jobs in the Phoenix queue.
To start the process you only need to use the BWA-GATKHC.Nov2017.sh script.  The script is best executed from either your /fast directory but you can also execute from /home.
All file outputs should be directed to /fast so make sure you have sufficient space available in that directory (usually around 300 GiB per genome).

Help on running the pipeline is available by running
/data/neurogenetics/git/PhoenixScripts/shared/scripts/BWA-GATKHC.Nov2017.sh -h

This will output script logs, a WGS metrics file, .bam file and .g.vcf.gz file with it's tabix index

You're welcome to check with me if you have trouble running the script or you get any errors:
